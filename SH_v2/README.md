# SurveyHustler

![SurveyHustler Logo]

## üí° Project Overview

SurveyHustler is a Telegram-based platform that connects survey requesters with a network of university students to get high-quality responses.

The platform provides a simple user flow:
- **For Requesters:** Users can upload survey details, define their target audience using filters, and pay to publish the survey. The system then automatically distributes the survey to the right audience.
- **For Respondents:** Students can complete surveys, earn cash rewards, and withdraw their earnings directly to their bank accounts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Telegram Bot Integration:** A seamless user interface is provided via a Telegram bot for all core interactions.
- **Audience Filtering:** Requesters can specify their target audience by university, college, department, course, gender, and academic level.
- **Automated Survey Distribution:** Surveys are automatically shared with users who match the defined demographic filters.
- **Payment Processing:** Integrates with the Korapay payment gateway to handle secure survey uploads and user payouts.
- **Secure Authentication:** User data is managed securely via Telegram IDs and a robust backend.
- **Database Management:** Uses PostgreSQL to store user profiles, survey details, and transaction history.
- **AI-powered Survey Analysis:** (Future Feature)
